# 3dScreen
This was one of my projects in the year 2018-2019 and the purpose was to rotate a screen and update the 3d model displayed in correlation with that. A key feature was that the screen would follow the user using computer vision.

The code is split it 3 parts, the main cpp file that handles computer vision, face detection and face tracking. It then sends all the needed data to a dll which acts as a bridge between the main cpp file and Blender(3d modeling and rendering software) python file

The code will be added here shortly, this project was semi functional when I moved on to something else so the 3d designs and overall physical assembly is not ideal.
